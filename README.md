A good starter for people who want to contribute to Machine Learning at Wikimedia. The Machine Learning Team uses KServe in the LiftWing K8s cluster, to implement the new model serving infrastructure that should replace ORES. 

See our [Wikitech documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing/KServe) for more information.
